	The program Move opens a window and allows a user to 
move a figure up, down, left, or right.  Internally, Move is
composed of a class Screen and relies on several calls to its
member functions.  The program first calls Screen's constructor
to initialize the private data members governing window 
dimensions and bits per pixel as well as the SDL surfaces that
represent the screen and the figure.  It then calls the function
initialize() to initialize the SDL functions, create the white
screen, load the PNG image of the figure, and set the window
caption.  The function will cause the program to end immediately
if any of those objects fails to initialize.  Move then calls
the function animate(), which places the figure on the screen
before entering a while loop.  The user now has 2 options:  
close the window or press 1 of the arrow keys.  Choosing the
former breaks the loop and returns control to the main function,
which then calls the function cleanUp() to free the figure and
quit SDL.  Choosing the latter results in the screen's background
being set to white and the figure being placed at a new location 
on the screen depending on which arrow was pressed.  Once the 
arrow key is released the screen is once again set to white and
the figure is placed back at its original location.  
	I verfied the program by testing whether or not the
figure would only move when the arrow keys were pressed and
whether or not the program properly ended once the window was
closed.  


	I have included the rubric that my partner an I drafted
during the first week of March.  I believe that we should 
receive those last 20 points because we were able to fulfill 
all of the requirements listed in that document and have
provided evidence in our respective dropboxes.  I have also 
uploaded a copy of the code I wrote over the break to our
gitHub repository under the directory "Move".
