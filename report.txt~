Special libraries
Our project relies on the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Library) library for
audio and video. This library is installed on University machines, and
all other libraries are fairly standard, so no additional libraries
should be necessary.

How to build
Use the included makefile to build the program with:

	$ make
	
The makefile can be edited to create an executable file with any
name by modifying the first line. Alternatively, the executable
can be manually renamed. To remove extraneous files and the
executable:

	$ make clean
	
The default name for the executable file is 'main', so to run
the script:

	$ ./main
	
This will launch a window that contains the game. The script will
exit when the window is closed.
