Final Projet:  Zombie Slayerz

Report


Special Libraries:
	Our project relies on the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Library)
libraries forimages (-lSDL_image), true type fonts (-lSDL_ttf), and 
audio (-lSDL_mixer) in addition to the standard SDL library( -lSDL). 
These libraries, with the possible exception of the audio library, 
should already be installed on the University machines.  All other 
libraries used are the standard C/C++ libraries.


Size Warning:
	Make sure you have at least 1.3 gigabytes of space in order 
to pull fromour Github repository.  This large size is unfortunately 
due to the image and audio files.


How to Build:
Use the included makefile to build the program with:

	$ make
	
	The makefile can be edited to create an executable file 
with any name by modifying the first line. Alternatively, the 
executable can be manually renamed. To remove extraneous files and 
the executable, use:

	$ make clean
	
	The default name for the executable file is 'slayerz', so
run the program with:

	$ ./slayerz
	
	This will launch a window that contains the game. The program
will exit when the window is closed.


User Manual:
	The program will immediately open a window displaying the
start screen of the game.  From there users can click on one of the
2 buttons to either start a game or to quit immediately.  Choosing
the latter will cause a farewell message to be displayed.  From there
users can close the window and thus end the program.  It should be 
noted that users can close the window at anytime during the game in 
order to exit the pogram.  
	Choosing to start a game will bring users to the difficulty 
selection screen.  From there users can choose between 4 different 
difficulties (the 4th one is hidden as an "easter egg" in the box that 
says "Select Difficulty") which affect the types and numbers of enemies 
on screen.  
	After choosing a difficulty, users will be taken to the game screen, 
where they will finally be able to control their character.  Users can 
move the character using either the arrow keys or W, A, S, and D.  They
can also attack the zombies using the space bar, which should kill them
if they are in range.  The player's health points are displayed in the 
upper left corner of the game screen and their total score is displayed
in the upper right.  Attacking and killing zombies will raise the player's
score while being attacked and taking damage will lower the player's health.
Once a player's health is reduced to 0, the user will be taken to the same 
screen he or she would have seen if they had chosen to quit at the start screen.
	1 of 4 powerups will apear at every 100 points the player earns 
and can be picked up by simply walking over them.  The 1st possible powerup
is the microphone, which kills every enemy on screen.  The 2nd is the guitar,
which slows down every enemy on screen.  The 3rd is the bass guitar, which
reduces the amount of damage each enemy on screen can do.  The 4th is the
drum, which freezes every enemy on screen in place.
	Pressing ESC at anytime while on the game screen will bring up
the pause menu.  From there users can either choose to return to their 
game, exit to the start screen, or quit the game.  Exiting to the start
screen allows a user to start another game, even a game at a different 
difficulty level.


Known Bugs:
	The most obvious bugs occurs due to the recoil effect applied to 
the player when he is injured.  Normally this effect causes the player to
jump back a bit away from the enemy.  However, the effect can sometimes
cause the player to be knocked further up or down the screen than intended,
which more often than not results in the player being jettisoned out of 
a pack of zombies into a clear area.  There is also a chance that the 
recoil effect could knock the player off the screen or into the sky area,
causing him to be stuck, though the chances of this happening are slim
due to the powerups spawning dead center on the screen and the middle
area of the game screen being a relative safe zone where no zombies
should spawn (or even get to if the player is on top of things).  Users
who get stuck due to this bug should pause and restart their game or quit.
	A minor bug occurs when a player tries to walk past a zombie going 
though its death animation.  The program still treats the zombie as if its 
alive, resulting in the player taking damage from being too close to it. 
	Other minor bugs with the program are caused by slight framerate
issues.  While these issues do not affect gameplay, they do result in a 
slight lag while going through the game menus as well as a bug where the
user starts a game and is immediately thrown into normal difficulty due
to the "Start" and "Normal" buttons on the start and difficulty select
screen respectively overlapping each other.
